## Examples : Anonymisers : SSID+MAC : I stage

### Intro
Here is an example of a script for anonymizing a log generated by Simple Wi-Fi Logger. In fact, the script given in this folder is improved (extended) version of an old script, with the help of which the example of the log file given earlier was anonymized.

### How it works?
If you run the script, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/averov90/Simple-Wi-Fi-Logger/raw/master/examples of log processors/Anonymisers/SSID+MAC/screenshot.png" width="768" alt="Screenshot of the program window">

Line `|| $valid:False 1/113` contains basic information about the current network being processed:
1. Name (between `|` chars), currently name feild is empty (network is hidden)
2. Auto-anonymise validity `$valid:False` - mean that auto-anonymise can not be done
3. Number of current network and count of networks to be processed: `1/113`

The next line contains char `|`, followed by the insertion cursor. 
Here you need to enter a new name for the network. You can do it completely manually (just by entering a new name), or you can use special characters so that the program partially changes the name itself.
Char `|` is needed to align the existing name with the new one. Further, it will be clear to you why this is needed.

Here's another example of how the old network name might be formatted:
```
|TP-Link_3D68| $valid:True 2/113
|
```

Here:
1. `TP-Link_3D68` - old name of the Wi-Fi network
2. `$valid:True` - network validity for auto-anonymise
3. `2/113` - number of current network

### Auto-anonymising
There are several behaviors in the program, depending on the input in the field:
1. empty field - if you didn't enter anything, the program will try to auto-change the network name.
2. `_` - do not make any changes. The network name will not be changed.
3. `-` - return to the previous network. If you enter this character, you can edit one previous network. You cannot trust more than one network.
4. `$` (1 or more) - the program will add 2 hexadecimal bytes to the existing name. `$` means to add 2 bytes. `$$` means to add 3 bytes. `$$$` means to add 1 byte.
5. spaces (1 or more) + `$` (1 or more) - replace the part of the name starting at the position of the dollar sign with 2 or 3 or 1 bytes.
6. `-` + string + `$` (1 or more) - add a line after the `-` sign to the old name and add 2 or 3 or 1 bytes to the name.
7. string + `$` (1 or more) - do not use the old name, but add 2 or 3 or 1 bytes to the new one.

Here's a typical example:
```
|Keenetic-51F0| $valid:True 4/113
|
Keenetic-$BE7F

|DIR-825-8B1E| $valid:True 5/113
|  $
DI$B0CC

|Free_Wi-Fi| $valid:False 6/113
|   $$
Fre$39A722

|Hoom| $valid:False 7/113
|-_my_$$$
Hoom_my_$D4

|Enot| $valid:False 8/113
|$
Enot_$C485

|MegaFonNetwork-BFE744| $valid:True 9/113
|my_name_$
my_name_$B22E

|Corben| $valid:False 10/113
|NoAuto
NoAuto

|RT-WiFi_6882| $valid:True 11/113
|
RT-WiFi_$105F

|pizza_puzzle| $valid:False 12/113
|
pizza_puzzle
```

Let's take a look at one of the examples:
```
|Free_Wi-Fi| $valid:False 6/113
|   $$
Fre$39A722
```
* `|Free_Wi-Fi| $valid:False 6/113` - string about old Wi-Fi network name
* `|   $$` - command to replace with offset
* `Fre$39A722` - resulting name. `Fre` - part of old name; `39A722` - random generated bytes; char `$` means position to MAC replacing for next (second) processing stage.

You may come across a special tag in the output:
```
|RT-5WiFi-F51F| $valid:True 19/113
|
RT-5WiFi-$C2BF

|Keenetic-8726| $valid:True 20/113
|
|Keenetic-$469B|$dup

|ZyXEL Keenetic Lite III| $valid:False 21/113
|
```

As you understand, we are talking about the `$dup` tag.
It means that if you discard the byte part after the `$` symbol, then such a string was already among the new names earlier.
For example, for earlier you had the resulting name `Keenetic-$6420`. 
Several renames later, you are again dealing with Keenetic products and the name `Keenetic-$AABB` is obtained. 
The name `Keenetic-$AABB` will have the `$dup` tag, since the same name was already contained in the replacements database (before the dollar sign). 
This tag, together with the undo (`-`) command, allows you to write the original names for the networks without fear of repeating them.

### Restrictions
Within the framework of this program, it is highly undesirable to deal with network names consisting of a small number of characters, since the actual replacement of names in the program is performed without taking into account the file structure. 
For example the name `name1` will be replaced with `name2` throughout the file. 
However, since such lines do not appear anyhow, the replacement will be performed only in the SSID column. 
However, if you replace `:` with `name`, then the replacement will also affect the MAC address line: `D4name60nameE3name21nameF8name54`, for example.

## Examples : Anonymisers : SSID+MAC : II stage
At this stage, you will not need to enter anything. However, it is important to understand what exactly is happening here.

The script of the second part in this edition randomizes the last 3 bytes of the MAC address. 
Randomization is not performed for the entire address, as usually the first few bytes identify the manufacturer. 
So, Keenetic routers will have the beginning of the address typical for ZyXEL. 
If you just insert a random address, it can be suspicious.

However, it is also important to note that many access points contain part of the MAC address in their SSID. 
This is not a rare occurrence to be ignored, so this situation is corrected by the special $ character in the SSID. 
This symbol is set by the script of the first part (you can see it in the resulting name in the script for entering replacements). 
This symbol tells the script of the second part from which part of the name to take the hexadecimal code and transfer it to the MAC.

The last 3 bytes of the MAC address are always randomized. However, thanks to the special character `$`, part of the whole of these 3 bytes can be taken from the name.
